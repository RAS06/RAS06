  <p> Rizwan Syed, Computer Science Student.</p> <br>
  <p> I write in: <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>TThe appropriate langauges for web design, HTML, CSS, and the appropriate langauges for configuring files, XML.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  I am familar with the JavaFX and JavaFX libraries, as well as Arduino Microcomputing, and a tiny bit of OpenGL. <br> Also an avid Linux User.
  </p>

  <p>I mostly work with data science and analysis, but I like to keep things interesting. I entertain myself by incorporating my sense of humor into my projects. <br><br> Some of my projects are as follows:</p> <br>
 
    
  <p> An <a href = "https://github.com/RAS06/The-ScizoCalendar-Project"> example </a>of my work in JavaFx. I will admit that this one is rather messy, and I really ought to have cleaned it up before turning it in, but I still got full points for it. This particlar (ssemingly basic) calendar program tells the story of a relgious community, terrorized by ancient devils stalking them from the woods via secret \"appointments\" that will flash randomly on the calendar (not written by the user). Intended to be a Vita Carnis-esque story presented in a Simcrulla-esque fashion and unexpectedly has no political undertones.</p>
  <p> The <a href = "https://github.com/RAS06/MicroFileManager"> MicroFileMangager, </a>which is essentially a directory system which points to notes-to-self on customizable categories, which the user can edit to keep information stored locally, save that information, and access it later (through a GUI, also an example of my work in JavaFx).</p>
  <p> A <a href = "https://github.com/RAS06/TermalIO"> wrapper </a> for a hypothetical Terminal game, which can be easily expanded by one with only slight knowledge of C++ into a literary tool of expression. I am aware that I spelled "Terminal" wrong, but I can't be bothered fixing it across all the areas of my system where it needs to be fixed, hence it shall remain incorrect.</p>  
  <p> And through my profile, you'll see a large number of very small, simple GUI designs that I had to write for class. </p>
  <br> <br>
    
  <p>And I'm always ready to learn more.</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <p> If you ever need me, you can ping my disc @Unbreakaskull, or you can email me.</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>Thanks for taking a look at my profile. Have a nice life.</p>
